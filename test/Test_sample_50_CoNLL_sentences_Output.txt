Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get certain diseases because of genetic changes .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
However , for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagonsed with certain genetic disease , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
On the one hand , we do not want this potential danger to cause frightening effects in our families' lives later .
When people around us know that we have a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , either caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted enough to worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us our whole life because we never know when the "potential bomb" will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways that can help us to control or cure the disease , we can go through this process from the perspective of the whole family .
For example , if exercising is helpful for the family to prevent a potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to exercise .
And we keep track of all family members’ health conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members who get this disease .
Here I want to share Forest’s view on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members , who are therefore also at risk , is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
If a certain disease genetic test is very accurate , it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and it is known by others , it is OK to disclose the result .
Above all , life is more important than keeping a secret .
Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another , although the families have a common genetic makeup , shared by either of the parents .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise to his or her relatives is solely a matter of preference within the individual’s moral system .
The issue on the right to know or not to know is highly debatable . Although it is a genetic risk , one cannot be entirely sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parent - maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousins .
This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurrently has knowledge about others .
This knowledge may be relevant to them , and vice versa .
Does one who suffers from this disease keep it a secret or inform his or her relatives ?
In retrospect , it is also one’s duty to ensure that he or she undergoes periodic health checks on his or her own .
Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from , the son or daughter , for example , the parent who knows about this would decide who gets told and who takes the precedence in being 'allowed' to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received the genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on the information to any offspring or adult at risk .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual's response to risk information as the person may not want to know .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on the information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with the authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority also extended 'vertically' .
From a practitioner's perspective , these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct , they may not be in line with the geneticists' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform at-risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal morals and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
People with a close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry a genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his / her close relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk so that his / her family members are able to perform some daily exercises to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the corresponding flaws .
In my opinion , although the announcement of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self-privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell about the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
Focus on the negative side of the announcement of the genetic risk first .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it a secret as the genetic risk may indicate their high chance of carrying certain diseases .
Especially for the young unmarried people , if he / she is known to have some genetic risk , there may be a certain chance that his / her child would carry the same disease , but it is not certain .
Therefore , keeping the information as a secret from his / her future spouse would help the relationship .
Secondly , announcing the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this issue , and although the factor might not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future and thus go to hospital for additional checks or take more medicines in order to prevent the disease , and this creates unnecessary costs to the family .
Furthermore , the announcement of the genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as sometimes they may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance of getting the potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help keep the privacy , it has much larger negative impacts on the family members and relatives .
First , in the case of marriage , people should be honest and tell their spouse that they may carry certain a genetic risk that may affect their offspring .
It is better to let the other party know the fact than to wait until the baby is born and a certain type of genetic disease is found .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the genes people are born with together with their daily habits .
